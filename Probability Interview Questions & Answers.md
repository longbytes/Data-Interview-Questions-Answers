## QUESTIONS

## Easy
### The Bayes' Theorem
- Explain Bayes' Theorem in your own words and describe a real-world situation where it can be applied.
- Given a medical test that has a 95% probability of detecting a disease when it is present and a 5% probability of indicating the disease when it's not present. If 1% of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease?
- Why is Bayes' Theorem important for data analysts and data scientists in making predictions based on prior knowledge?

### Conditional Probability
- Define conditional probability and provide an example.
- If P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 0.4, and P(A and B) = 0.2, what is P(A|B)?
- How is conditional probability different from joint probability?

### Normal Distribution
- What properties define the normal distribution?
- Why is the normal distribution significant in statistics and data science?
- Given a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, what percentage of the data lies between 40 and 60?

### Uniform Distribution
- Describe a situation where a uniform distribution might be applicable.
- What are the mean and variance of a continuous uniform distribution defined between a and b?
- How does the probability density function of a uniform distribution look?

### Bernoulli Distribution
- Define a Bernoulli trial and give an example.
- How does the probability mass function of a Bernoulli distribution look?
- What are the mean and variance of a Bernoulli distribution?

### Binomial Distribution
- Under what conditions is a binomial distribution used?
- Given 10 trials with a success probability of 0.2, what is the probability of achieving exactly 3 successes?
- How does the binomial distribution change as the number of trials increases?

### Geometric Distribution
- Describe the geometric distribution and its application.
- If the probability of success in a trial is 0.3, what's the expected number of trials to get the first success?
- How is the geometric distribution different from the binomial distribution?

### Poisson Distribution
- When is it appropriate to use the Poisson distribution?
- Given a mean rate of 5 events per hour, what is the probability of observing exactly 7 events in an hour?
- How is the Poisson distribution related to the binomial distribution?

### Exponential Distribution
- Explain the relationship between the Poisson and exponential distributions.
- If the average time between events is 10 minutes, what is the probability that the next event will occur within the next 5 minutes?
- Describe a scenario where the exponential distribution might be useful.

### Deriving the Mean and Variance of Distributions
- How do you compute the mean and variance of a discrete probability distribution?
- Why is understanding the mean and variance important for a data analyst or data scientist?
- What does a variance of zero indicate about a distribution?

### Central Limit Theorem
- What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?
- If you were to take repeated samples of size n from a population, how would the distribution of sample means look as n increases?
- Why is the Central Limit Theorem crucial for hypothesis testing?

### The Birthday Problem
- Describe the Birthday Paradox. How is it counterintuitive?
- What is the probability that in a group of 23 people, at least two share the same birthday?
- How does the probability change as the size of the group increases?

### Card Probability Problems
- If you draw a card from a standard deck, what is the probability it's a heart or a queen?
- What is the probability of drawing 2 aces in a row from a shuffled deck of 52 cards?
- How many ways can you arrange 5 cards drawn from a standard deck?

### Die Roll Problems
- What's the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice?
- If you roll a fair six-sided die three times, what is the probability of rolling at least one 6?
- How would you calculate the expected value of a single die roll?
