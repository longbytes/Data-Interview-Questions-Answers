# SQL & DB Interview Questions & Answers # 

The following list starts with foundational concepts and progressively gets into more complex and specialized areas of database knowledge.

## Easy ##
* [What is the primary key, and why is it important? What characteristics does a good primary key have?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#what-is-the-primary-key-and-why-is-it-important) (Microsoft)
* [How do I choose the right primary key for my table?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#how-do-i-choose-the-right-primary-key-for-my-table)
* [What is the foreign key, and why is it important? How does it relate to a primary key?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#what-is-the-foreign-key-and-why-is-it-important) (KPMG)
* [What is a database view? What are some advantages views have over tables?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Facebook)
* Describe some advantages and disadvantages of relational databases vs. NoSQL databases. (Amazon)
* What is normalization, and why is it important?
* Explain Indexing.
* What is ACID, and how does it relate to database transactions?
* How do you handle duplicate data points in a SQL query?
* What is data warehousing, and how does it differ from a traditional database?
* Name one major similarity and difference between a WHERE clause and a HAVING clause in SQL. (Amazon)
* Describe what a clustered index and a non-clustered index are. Compare and contrast the two. (Microsoft)

## Medium to Hard ## 
* How would you optimize a SQL query to run faster?
* [Say you have a database system where most queries were UPDATEs/INSERTs/DELETEs. How would this affect your decision to create indices? What if the queries made were mostly SELECTs and JOINs instead?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Expedia)
* [Say you want to set up a MapReduce job to implement a shuffle operator, whose input is a dataset and whose output is a randomly ordered version of that same dataset. Describe the steps in the shuffle operator's algorithm at a high level.](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Capital One)
* [Say you have the entire Facebook social graph (users and their friendships). How would you use MapReduce to find the number of mutual friends for every pair of Facebook users?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Facebook) 
* [Assume you are tasked with designing a large-scale system that tracks a variety of search query strings and their frequencies. How would you design this, and what trade-offs would you need to consider?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Google)
