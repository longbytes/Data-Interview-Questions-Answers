# SQL & DB Interview Questions & Answers # 

The following list starts with foundational concepts and progressively gets into more complex and specialized areas of database knowledge.

## Easy ##

* [How do I choose the right primary key for my table?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#how-do-i-choose-the-right-primary-key-for-my-table)
* [What is the foreign key, and why is it important? How does it relate to a primary key?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#what-is-the-foreign-key-and-why-is-it-important) (KPMG)

## Medium to Hard ## 
* How would you optimize a SQL query to run faster?
* [Say you have a database system where most queries were UPDATEs/INSERTs/DELETEs. How would this affect your decision to create indices? What if the queries made were mostly SELECTs and JOINs instead?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Expedia)
* [Say you want to set up a MapReduce job to implement a shuffle operator, whose input is a dataset and whose output is a randomly ordered version of that same dataset. Describe the steps in the shuffle operator's algorithm at a high level.](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Capital One)
* [Say you have the entire Facebook social graph (users and their friendships). How would you use MapReduce to find the number of mutual friends for every pair of Facebook users?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Facebook) 
* [Assume you are tasked with designing a large-scale system that tracks a variety of search query strings and their frequencies. How would you design this, and what trade-offs would you need to consider?](https://github.com/longnguyendata/Interview-Answers/tree/main#ace-the-data-science-interview-book---sqldb) (Google)
